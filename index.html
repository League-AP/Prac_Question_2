Consider a program that models a dog kennel. A dog may be represented with the following interface:

public interface Dog
{
	/** @return the dog's name */
	String getName();

	/** @return the name of the dog's owner */
	String getOwnerName();
}

A dog kennel consists of n numbered slots. Each slot can hold at most one dog. The slots are indexed from 0 to n − 1. No two dogs in the kennel have the same name, but two or more dogs may have the same owner.

The declaration of the DogKennel class is shown below.

public class DogKennel
{
	/** The slots in the kennel. Each array element contains a
	 *  reference to a dog that is currently occupying that slot.
	 *  A null value indicates an empty space.
	 */
	private Dog[] slots;

	/** Returns the name of the owner of the dog
	 *  whose name is given. Returns null if the dog is not found.
	 *  Precondition:  No two dogs in the kennel have the same name.
	 *  @param name the name of the dog to find
	 *  @return the name of the specified dog's owner;
	 *  null, if no dog with the specified name is in the kennel
	 */
	public String findOwner(String name)
	{ /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

	/** Consolidates the kennel by moving dogs so that the dogs are in
	 *  adjacent slots, starting at index 0, with no empty slot between
	 *  any two dogs.
	 *  Postcondition: The order of dogs is the same as before consolidation.
	 */
	public void moveTogether()
	{ /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

	//There may be instance variables, constructors and methods
	//that are not shown.
}

Part (a)
Write the DogKennel method findOwner, which returns the name of the owner of the dog whose name is specified. Method findOwner should return null if the given dog is not found.

Write your solution below.

/** Returns the name of the owner of the dog
 *  whose name is given. Returns null if the dog is not found.
 *  Precondition:  No two dogs in the kennel have the same name.
 *  @param name the name of the dog to find
 *  @return the name of the specified dog's owner;
 *  null, if no dog with the specified name is in the kennel
 */
public String findOwner(String name)

Part (b)
Write the DogKennel method moveTogether. This method consolidates the kennel by moving dogs so that the dogs are in adjacent slots starting at index 0, with no empty slots between any two dogs. After the kennel is consolidated, the dogs should be in the same order as they were before consolidation.

Note: You may not use a temporary array in your solution!

For example, suppose a kennel has dogs in the following slots. (In the diagram, each dog has the name of its owner shown underneath the dog's name.)
0		1		2		3		4		5
_____________________________________________________________________________________
“Fido”		null		“Coco”		null		“Jake”		null
“Tom Smith”			“Joe Doe”			“Sam Jed”
_____________________________________________________________________________________

This should be the arrangement after moveTogether is called:

0		1		2		3		4		5
_____________________________________________________________________________________
“Fido”		“Coco”		“Jake”		null		null		null
“Tom Smith”	“Joe Doe”	“Sam Jed”			
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Write method moveTogether below.

/** Consolidates the kennel by moving dogs so that the dogs are in
 *  adjacent slots, starting at index 0, with no empty slot between
 *  any two dogs.
 *  Postcondition: The order of dogs is the same as before consolidation.
 */
public void moveTogether()
